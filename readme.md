# AblePM App

This is a python app that is used to manage the AblePM package manager.

## Components

The AblePM App is made up of the following components:
- [python 3.10 or higher](https://www.python.org/downloads/) - the python interpreter
- [os](https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html) - the command that allows us to make files and run commands
- [sys](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sys.html) - ditto
- [platform](https://docs.python.org/3/library/platform.html) - for determining the operating system
- And that's it! (other than the [random](https://docs.python.org/3/library/random.html) library)
